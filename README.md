ng-availability-calendar
========

## Why?

In need of displaying a swazzy calendar for a project that involved booking, I came across a cool JS library: [Raphael.js](https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael). As my app was built in Angular 1.x, I decided to build a module that builds on the dots example and displays a booking calendar.

```
bower install ng-availability-calendar
